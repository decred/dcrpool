# dcrpool 

[![Build Status](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/actions)

dcrpool is a stratum decred mining pool. It currently supports:

* Innosilicon D9 (default port: 5552, supported firmware: [D9_20180602_094459.swu](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wofB_OUDkB2gxz_IS7wM8Br6ogKdYDmY))
* Antminer DR3 (default port: 5553)
* Antminer DR5 (default port: 5554)
* Whatsminer D1 (default port: 5555)

The pool can be configured to mine in solo pool mode or as a publicly available 
mining pool.  Solo pool mode represents a private mining pool operation where 
all connected miners to the pool are owned by the pool administrator.  For this 
reason, mining rewards are left to accumulate at the specified address for the 
mining node. There isn't a need for payment processing in solo pool mining mode, 
it is disabled as a result. 

In solo pool mining mode, miners only need to identify themselves when 
connecting to the pool. The miner's username, specifically the username sent 
in a `mining.authorize` message should be a unique name identifying the client.

Here is a sample config for solo mining:

```
rpcuser=RPC_USER
rpcpass=RPC_PASS
dcrdrpchost=DCRD_RPC_HOST
dcrdrpccert=DCRD_RPC_CERT
debuglevel=trace
solopool=true
activenet=NETWORK
backuppass=BACKUP_PASS
guidir=GUI_DIR
```

Refer to config descriptions for more detail on the options.

The pool supports Pay Per Share (`PPS`) and Pay Per Last N Shares (`PPLNS`) 
payment schemes when configured for pool mining.

With pool mining, mining clients connect to the pool, contribute work towards 
solving a block and claim shares for participation. When a block is found by 
the pool, portions of the mining reward due participating accounts are 
calculated based on claimed shares and the payment scheme used. The pool pays 
out the mining reward portions due each participating account when it matures.

In addition to identifying itself to the pool, each connecting miner has to 
specify the address its portion of the mining reward should be sent to when a 
block is found. For this reason, the mining client's username is a combination 
of the address mining rewards are paid to and its name, formatted as: 
`address.name`. This username format for pool mining is required. The pool uses 
the address provided in the username to create an account, all other connected 
miners with the same address set will contribute work to that account.  

Here is a sample config for pool mining:

```
rpcuser=RPC_USER
rpcpass=RPC_PASS
dcrdrpchost=DCRD_RPC_HOST
dcrdrpccert=DCRD_RPC_CERT
walletgrpchost=WALLER_GRPC_HOST
walletrpccert=WALLET_RPC_CERT
debuglevel=trace
maxgentime=MAX_GEN_TIME
solopool=false
activenet=NETWORK
walletpass=WALLET_PASS
poolfeeaddrs=PFEE_ADDR
paymentmethod=PAYMENT_METHOD
lastnperiod=LAST_N_PERIOD
backuppass=BACKUP_PASS
guidir=GUI_DIR
```

Refer to config descriptions for more detail on the options.

The user interface of the pool provides public access to statistics and pool 
account data. Users of the pool can access all payments, mined blocks by the 
account and also work contributed by clients of the account via the interface. 
The interface is only accessible via HTTPS and by default uses a self-signed 
certificate, served on port `:8080`. In production, particularly for pool 
mining, a certificate from an authority (`CA`) like 
[letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is recommended. The user interface also 
provides pool administrators database backup  functionality when needed.

To deploy the user interface, copy `dcrpool/gui/assets` folder to a reachable 
location and update the gui directory (`--guidir`) of the configuration.

To install and run dcrpool:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/decred/dcrpool.git
cd dcrpool 
go install 
dcrpool --configfile=path/to/config.conf 
```

The project has a tmux mining harness and a cpu miner for testing. 
Refer to `harness.sh` for configuration details. 

To install and run the cpu miner:  

```sh
cd dcrpool/cmd/miner 
go install 
miner --configfile=path/to/config.conf 
```

To run the mining harness:  

```sh
cd dcrpool
./harness.sh 
```

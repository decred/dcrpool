## Breaking Changes.
1. `--cpuport`, `--d9port`, `--dr3port`,`--dr5port`,`--d1port` and `--dcr1port` have been removed in favour of `--minerport` ([#274](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/274)).

2. `--homedir` has been renamed to `--appdata` in order to be consistent wih dcrd and dcrwallet ([#312](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/312)).

## Bug Fixes.
1. Payment processing now handles dust payments by filtering them out of transactions generated by the pool. ([#254](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/254))

2. Fixed a solo pool work submission related bug where valid submissions less than the pool target were being rejected. ([#286](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/286))

3. Fixed a gui related bug where the gui would fail to update because the cache was not being properly updated on block connections. ([#297](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/297))

4. Fixed a cpu miner related bug where the authorization request was being sent regardless of the state of the subscribtion request. ([#297](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/297))

5. Fixed a bug related to marshaling and unmarshaling stratum errors. ([#304](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/304))


## Improvements.

1. Error types have been updated to leverage go 1.13 errors.Is/As functionality. ([#245](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/245))

2. `--conftimeout` has been added to control coinbase confirmation durations when sourcing payment transaction inputs. ([#250](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/250))

3. Added postgres support to facilitate multi-instance deployments. ([#282](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/282))

4. A single miner endpoint configurable via `--minerport` has been added to simplify the connection process. ([#274](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/274))

5. `--monitorcycle` and `--maxupgradetries` have been added to allow miner monitoring and upgrade cycles. ([#274](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/274))

6. Client hash data is now persisted to ensure coherent and unifom data access for multi-instance deployments. ([#293](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/293))

7. Facilitate reverse proxy deployments by allowing serving the pool over HTTP and allowing further endpoint configurability by updating `--minerport` and `--guiport` to `--minerlisten` and `--guilisten`. ([#301](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/301))

8. The pool now properly handles `mining.extranonce.subscribe` requests by explicitly stating no support for it. ([#304](https://github.com/decred/dcrpool/pull/304))
